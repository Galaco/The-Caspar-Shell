# The Caspar Shell

The Shell was created by [@mityalebedev](https://github.com/mityalebedev/).

Theme has been modified for personal use, adding sections of Caspar that I desired.

Additions:
* Added+styled Ghost's Caspar theme's navbar
* Several color adjustments and font changes
* Used the header bar on post page as well
* Updated Disqus support


### Disqus and google analytics support:

Add the following code_injection:
```
<script>
var d_id = 'XXX', //<XXX.disqus.com
	g_id = 'UA-XXXXXXX-X';//your google analytics tracking id
</script>
```
